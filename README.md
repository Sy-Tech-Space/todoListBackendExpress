# todoListBackend
This project uses express.js (web application framework for Node.js)

The code structure follows MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern where the model (Tasks) interacts with the database, the service layer (TaskService) abstracts the business logic, and the controller (controller.js) handles HTTP requests and responses. 
The database configuration is separated for better organization and reusability.
